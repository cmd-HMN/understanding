# Understanding 📚  

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=python)](https://www.python.org/)  [![Jupyter Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Notebook-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=jupyter)](https://jupyter.org/) [![cmd-HMN](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributions-Welcome-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/cmd-HMN)  

🚀 **"Understanding"** is a repository dedicated to **building Machine Learning algorithms from scratch**—no shortcuts, just pure Python! Instead of relying on libraries like scikit-learn, we'll implement everything **step-by-step** to gain deep insights into how ML models work.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- 🏗️ [`Linear Regression`](https://github.com/cmd-HMN/understanding/blob/main/Linear_Regression) → Implementation of Linear Regression **from scratch - (main purpose is to Understand what actually happens)**


🔮 **Coming Soon:**  
- 🔍 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- 🌳 Decision Trees  
- 🧠 Neural Networks (Yes, from scratch too!)  
- ...and more! 🚀
